## Familiar Costumes

Hades II mod allowing you to select new cosmetics for familiars. Includes a few custom skins and edited ambient critter textures if available.

Options to pin favorite cosmetics and randomize them on a new run.

Compatible with [Cerberus Familiar](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/zerp/Cerberus_Familiar/), options to switch to unrivaled cerberus.

## Installation

Use r2modman by ebkr from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest).

While the mod has been tested decently well it is recommended to backup your save from `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Hades II\Profile*.sav` in case there are issues.

## Usage

Select the new cosmetics from the in-game familiar costume menu. Requires the incantation "Alteration of Familiar Forms" to be unlocked.
